Being a music lover, you want to create an application that allows you to manage albums.

The goal here is to create the backend with Node/Express.

Here are the user stories that tell you which routes you will have to implement on your backend, and which SQL queries will have to be executed:

-- DB Model --
- create the database model to manage albums and tracks


-- Album --
- as a user, I want to be able to see all albums.
- as a user, I want to be able to create a new album.
- as a user, I want to be able to see an album by entering its id in the url.
- as a user, I want to be able to modify an album.
- as a user, I want to be able to delete an album.


-- Track --
- as a user, I want to be able to see all songs.
- as a user, I want to create and assign a song to an album.
- as a user, I want to list all the songs from an album.
- as a user, I want to edit a song from an album.
- as a user, I want to delete a song.


You will have to respect the following rules on your routes:

- The body of the **HTTP requests** must be in the **JSON format**
- The body of the **HTTP responses** must be in the **JSON format**
- HTTP requests for **reading** must **return the element(s)** back into the HTTP response
- HTTP requests for **creation and modification** must **return the created/modified element** in the HTTP response
- HTTP requests for **deletion** must not **return any element** in the HTTP response

**Complies with REST principles, especially with regard to naming different routes and HTTP return codes.**

- [REST best practices](https://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/)

Be sure to group the routes using the Express router and test the API with Postman.
